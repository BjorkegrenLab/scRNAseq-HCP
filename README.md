# scRNAseq-HCP
scRNA-seq of human carotid plaques.
Smart-Seq2 technology was used to generate single cells from fifteen carefully characterized patients (8 males and 7 females) eligible for carotid endarterectomy surgery because of significant stenosis (>70%) in the proximal part of their internal carotid arteries in this study. To provide clinical and pathological context to these single-cell subclusters they were integrated with gene regulatory networks (GRN) from the STARNET study.
